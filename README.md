# Thunderbringer
Turn that frown upside down!  Thunderbringer will make your website have that new car smell again!

Anyone who's anyone can surf that web and stumble upon a website from the 90s.  Don't we all wish we could upgrade websites to a responsive site, or at least make it pleasant to the eyes?

Never fear!  Thunderbringer aims to take a clunky old website and make it new again.  I know what you are thinking- you can't automate a process like converting an old website to a new one!  I agree, you can't do it- completely.  Thunderbringer aims to assist developers to at least have somewhere to start.

Clone the repo, enter the directory, install dependencies, and run grunt

```shell
C:\workspace\thunderbringer>npm install -g grunt
C:\workspace\thunderbringer>npm install
C:\workspace\thunderbringer>bower install bootstrap
C:\workspace\thunderbringer>grunt
```
